      "2. **Technical Depth**: While the paper provides a good overview of the technical design components, it could benefit from more in-depth technical discussions, particularly in sections like the methodology and results.\n",
      "3. **Visualizations and Tables**: The inclusion of tables and figures is helpful, but some of them, such as Table I and Fig. 1, could be more clearly explained or referenced in the text.\n",
      "4. **Limitations and Future Work**: The discussion of limitations and future directions is a good start, but it could be more comprehensive, highlighting specific areas for improvement and potential research questions.\n",
